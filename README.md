## Status

I focused on small incremental improvements through separation of concerns.
In the branch `extract-data-and-output-rendering-to-files`, I separated the
data handling and output rendering. Subsequently, in the branch `extract-lib`,
I isolated the core algorithm into a dedicated library file.

The full changes can be reviewed in the associated pull requests.

I prefer small steps and improving abstraction before focusing more on
feature completeness for the algorithm.
